Description: 
"The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." - Authur Samuel.

A more technical and careful description of machine learning (ML) was given by Tom Mitchell as: "A computer is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
ML is believed to be the fundations of real artificial intelligence. If computers can learn, then they can really be intelligent.
